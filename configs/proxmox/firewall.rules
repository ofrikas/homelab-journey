# Proxmox Firewall Rules
# Currently using Cloudflare Tunnel - no direct port exposure needed

# Note: With Cloudflare Tunnel, we don't need to open any inbound ports!
# The tunnel creates an outbound connection to Cloudflare,
# and all traffic flows through that encrypted tunnel.

# Future firewall rules to consider:
# - Rate limiting for SSH (port 22)
# - Fail2ban integration
# - Block all inbound except from local network
# - Allow only Cloudflare IPs if using direct proxy mode

# Example rules (not currently active):
# IN ACCEPT -source 10.100.102.0/24 -p tcp -dport 8006
# IN DROP -p tcp -dport 8006
# IN ACCEPT -source 10.100.102.0/24 -p tcp -dport 22
# IN DROP -p tcp -dport 22
